# React + Vite

I recently completed my first professional project for a client, a React application built with Vite. The project is hosted on Vercel at https://job-portal-delta-six.vercel.app/

To optimize development, I utilized the @vitejs/plugin-react which leverages Babel for Fast Refresh, ensuring a smooth and efficient coding experience. Additionally, I explored @vitejs/plugin-react-swc, which uses SWC for Fast Refresh, providing an alternative approach for enhancing development speed.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
